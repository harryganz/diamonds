# Diamond Search Engine Scraper

### Overview

[The diamond search engine](http://diamondse.info) is a great resource for looking
up prices of cut diamonds, but it doesn't have an easily usable API or a central
dataset. I wrote this scraper to pull data from the website and export it to CSV.

Check [NEWS](./NEWS.md) for information on changes.

### Getting Started

This is still a work in progress, but eventually I hope to build a command line
application for running the scraper as well as a Go package.
Eventually I plan on analyzing the scraped data in R.
